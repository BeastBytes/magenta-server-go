The purpose of the chat server is to provide communication channels between multiple users.  A user can join chatrooms (one or more at any given time), and send and receive chat messages in those chat rooms from other users.

Everyone in a chat room will receive any chats sent from any user within that chat room.

A user may create a new room.

A user may send a private message to one or more other users on the same server.

The server will be able to archive all messages in a database for later retrieval by users.
